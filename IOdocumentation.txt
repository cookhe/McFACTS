Input/output documentation

Default input file : model_choice.txt
The default input file is described here; if you create your own input file, 
you must use the same nomenclature and ORDER as the default file to set your variables, and can use 
# to denote comments on lines separate from your inputs.
Inputs are grouped astrophysically, with accretion disk variables first, nuclear
star cluster variables second, and assorted other choices (time resolution etc.) last.

    Parameters
    ----------
    smbh_mass : float
        supermassive black hole mass in units of solar masses
        default : 1.e8
    disk_model_name : string
        prefix to filenames for input disk model
        McFACTS comes with the following example options for disk models:
        flat: constant surface density & aspect ratio (unphysical)
        sirko_goodman: from Sirko & Goodman 2003
        thompson_etal: from Thompson, Quataert & Murray 2005
        If user has a disk model, it must specify the disk surface density
           as a function of radius in a file called name_surface_density.txt
           where the surface density is in units of kg/m^2 and the radius is in
           units of gravitational radii (R_g=GM_SMBH/c^2).
           McFACTS assumes the innermost specified radius in the disk surface density
           input file is the inner edge of the disk, and the outermost specified 
           radius is the outer edge.
           User must also supply the disk aspect ratio as a function of radius
           in a file called name_aspect_ratio.txt
           Both files must have surface density & aspect ratio specified at the
               SAME set of radii.
           Here name = disk_model_name
           default : 'sirko_goodman'
    disk_radius_trap : float
        If the disk has a migration trap, its radius must be specified here 
            in units of graviatational radii (R_g=GM_SMBH/c^2) of the SMBH
            to prevent overshooting in coarse grained models. If there is no
            trap, set trap_radius = 0. (all BH will eventually accrete onto SMBH)
            see Bellovary et al. 2016 for locations of sirko_goodman or thompson_etal
                migration trap 
            default: 700.0

    nsc_radius_crit : float
        Critical radius of Nuclear Star Cluster in units of pc, where radial number density changes (becomes more Bahcall-Wolf like). 
        This is ~0.25pc for Milky Way (Generozov+18).
            default: 0.25
    nsc_ratio_bh_num_star_num : float

    nsc_density_index_inner : float
        Index of radial density profile of Nuclear Star Cluster at r<r_nsc_crit. Implicit assumed negative.
        E.g. Bahcall-Wolf is n \propto r^-7/4 (& in Generozov+18). So e.g. 1.75 is the index here not -1.75.

    nsc_density_index_outer: float
        Index fo radial density profile of Nuclear Star Cluster at r>r_nsc_crit. Implicit assumed negative.

    nsc_bh_spin_dist_sigma : float
        standard deviation of initial dimensionless spin magnitude distribution (small is good)
        default : 0.1
    disk_bh_torque_condition : float
        fraction of initial mass required to be accreted before BH spin is torqued 
        fully into alignment with the AGN disk. We don't know for sure but 
        Bogdanovic et al. says between 0.01=1% and 0.1=10% is what is required
        default : 0.1
    disk_bh_eddington_ratio : float

        Eddington accretion rate. 1.0=embedded BH accreting at Eddington.
        Super-Eddington accretion rates are permitted.
        default : 1.0
    disk_bh_orb_ecc_max_init : float
        this is the initial eccentricity of a single orbiter around SMBH
        want to eventually turn this into some physically motivated thing
        for now assuming uniform distribution [0.0 .. max_initial_eccentricity]
        default : 0.3
    timestep_duration_yr : float
        McFACTS evolves populations once per timestep according to chosen physics
        Choose a timestep that allows some things to happen, but not everything
        to happen in one timestep. Migration timescale across your disk is a
        good fiducial: 10kyr=1.e4 is a reasonable choice in a Sirko & Goodman
        disk with a lot of 10Msun BH. Timestep is in units of years.
        default : 1.e4
    timestep_num : int
        Disk lifetime is set by choosing your number of timesteps:
        lifetime = timestep * number_of_timesteps
        choosing default settings gives 1Myr lifetime
        default : 100

    iteration_num : float
        Number of iterations of code. 
        Choosing default settings gives 1 run. Quick test for n_iterations = 30.
        default : 1            
    flag_thermal_feedback : int
        Switch to incorporate a feedback model from accreting embedded BH. Changes migration rates.
        feedback = 1 makes all BH subject to gas torque modification due to feedback 
        feedback = 0 means no BH gas torque modifications (Type I migration only).
        Feedback model right now is Hanka et al. 2022
        default : 1
    flag_orb_ecc_damping : int
        Switch to incorporate orbital eccentricity damping.
        orb_ecc_damping = 1 gives all BH an initial orb eccentricity 
        which must be damped to <crit_ecc before it can form a binary. Means there's usually a delay before binaries form.
        orb_ecc_damping = 0 gives all BH the value of crit_ecc (usually 0.01) for initial orb eccentricity. Means 
        binaries can form straight away (they're all assumed circularized)
        default : 1

    capture_time_yr : int
        Time between disk captures in units of years. From Secunda+2021, capture time is 1 per 0.1Myr.
        default : 1.e5
    disk_radius_capture_outer : int
        Outer radius at which capture can occur in units of R_g=GM_SMBH/c^2. From Fabj+20, ~2000R_g is reasonable.
        default : 2.e3
    disk_bh_pro_orb_ecc_crit : int
        Value of critical eccentricity below which it is assumed circularized in its orbit & can migrate/ form binaries.
        default : 0.01
    flag_dynamic_enc : int
        Switch to allow for dynamical interactions. 
        If dynamic_enc = 1 then interactions between circularized BH (e<crit_ecc) and eccentric BH (e>crit_ecc) are followed.
        Calculates probability of interaction per timestep. 
        If there is an interaction then energy de is added to circularized BH and taken from eccentric BH.
        Eccentricity of circularized BH is increased by de and eccentricity of interloper is decreased by de.
        default : 0
    delta_energy_strong : float
        Average change in orbital energy/eccentricity of BH post-encounter between a circularized and eccentric BH.
        For de = 0.1, the circularized BH increases semi-major axis a_circ to (1+de)a_circ 
        and increases eccentricity e_crit to e_crit+de
        The eccentric BH decreases semi-major axis a_ecc to (1-de)a_ecc 
        and decreases eccentricity e to e-de.
        default : 0.1
